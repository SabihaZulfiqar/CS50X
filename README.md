<h1> CS50 Psets 2021 </h1>
<p>CS50 is an introductory course to the field of computer science which goes over all the basic concepts in detail. The scope of theory and practical skills taught in the course is second to none. The topics for the first five weeks include array manipulation, data structures, algorithms, and memory management in C, while the later weeks focus on a new programming language each week and the course wraps up with an introduction to web programming. This is my attempt at solving the problem sets in each week of the 12 week course.</p>
